I started a gym routine on last month, to be precise 28 April 2025. It was not a sudden decision. I had been procrastinating this from last 2 or 3 years !! Even brought a Cult Play membership, which I used for learning swimming. Then that Cult center closed. That time Cult team gave me choice to retain either  Play membership and start going for swim in other centres. Or convert it into gym plan. I chose gym plan. But never visited the gym with that. 

Then I decided, I can try a local gym near to my place. It was after I did some blood work done, and results were not favourable. 

Anyway, after starting gym I feel good. I think just because I get up early, focus on food, and consciously avoiding food bad for me. It's a good start. 

Let's see where this leads me.
