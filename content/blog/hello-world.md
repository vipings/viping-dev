There’s a strange moment — usually around 3:20PM — when nothing demands my attention.

No incident. No Slack ping. No email loop.

Just… silence.

And for years, I tried to fill it.

But over time, I’ve come to realize something:

> That boring 10 minutes? It’s not empty. It’s loaded.

## Boredom is where systems emerge

When I'm bored, my brain starts refactoring ideas. Not code — **concepts.**  
Architecture. Tradeoffs. Priorities. Pain points no dashboard will ever show me.

Boredom lets the deeper parts of my mind surface with insights that don’t arrive in a sprint review or Slack thread.

---

## It's not about laziness — it's about space

As an SRE, most of what I do is **reduce chaos**.

And I’ve started to believe: you can’t reduce chaos **externally** if you’re constantly stimulating chaos **internally**.

The more intentional my boredom, the more calm I bring to on-call.  
The more space I make for stillness, the better my infrastructure becomes.

---

## So now I protect my boring moments

Sometimes I just stare out the window.  
Sometimes I open a blank file and type until something that isn’t noise shows up.

Sometimes I do nothing.

That’s not anti-productivity. That’s **preparing to do real work.**

---

## tl;dr

If you build things, fix things, or keep things running — try being bored.

Not the scrolling, fake boredom. The **intentional, empty kind**.

You might find clarity.  
You might design something better.  
Or maybe — you’ll just enjoy a rare moment of nothing.

Either way, your future self will thank you.
