If you check the first writings in the blog is-you guessed it- AI generated. It's a pity. But that's the new world looks like. At least for me. I started to delegate tasks to LLMs. But for good or bad, I'm writing this for myself with my own thoughts and inefficiencies. I'm not a good writer. But I want to be. I have a book sitting on my desk, which came last week from Amazon. You might be knowing it - On Writing Well by William Zinsser. I've to read it. Maybe, maybe in distant future, I would be able to write well.

Anyway, I am not going to admit failure early. I won't feed this post to some LLM and polish it. Let it be vulnerable enough with all the mistakes and what not. Let it be.

For now, I feel like I'm writing a lot for a blog which has born hours ago.

I don't want to burn out. Maybe my brain will tell me never write a blog again!

So let's stop here. I will come back with another thought.
