I don't know the name of the professor who has 80 mins of memory. But I know his obsession with numbers. 
I don't know the name of the housekeeper who is insanely human and down to earth. But I know her curiosity to learn the unknown.
I don't know the name of the kid who wear a baseball cap and tune the radio for the baseball match updates. But I know how mature enough he is to deal with an old man who has short term memory. 

This is the story I loved reading. It made me sad sometimes, made me laugh sometimes. It has everything. Slow, but fast enough for anyone who loves this kind of story telling. Without forcing anything in you, Ogawa's words will reach in your heart and will stay for long.
