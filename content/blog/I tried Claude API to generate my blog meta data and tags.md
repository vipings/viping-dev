I brought $5 credits for generating the metadata, tags and categories for my blog posts. There might be better ways using local llm or some other tools. 
I just wanted to check the use case. I write my blogs in Obsidian. And just press cmd+shift+d to deploy. The process seems very much easy. But only downside was I was manually filling up tags, description etc. I don't want LLM to proof read or rephrase my blogs. Then there is no point in writing. I want to write my own blog but don't want to manually create the tags. 
Tags are useful in filtering my posts. Right now there are handful of posts, but when it grows in number, tags would be a valuable tool. 
Claude Code helped to to set up a simple script which calls the Claude API and generate these tags and all. Also Claude convinced me that, with $5, I can write around 40000 posts ! 
So I hope it's not going to run out.
