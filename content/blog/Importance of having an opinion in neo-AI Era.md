When someone asks what you want, you should not say whatever. Thats my take on the life. This is particularly important in any decision we need to take. Don't put a cognitive sedation in any of that. Every decision, even ordering food in a restaurant makes should makes you think instead of easily repeating whatever other want or already ordered. 

In a world where cognitive skills are outsourced to AI agents, this simple decision making is more often than needed. I've seen people search for best things based on reviews, which became a norm. Everything becomes highly reviewed digitally even we are not sure it could be trustworthy. 

In my opinion, every decision should be made with our own analytical skills than following blinding from a bot. 

Decisions and choices makes life as we know. Chose it wisely.
