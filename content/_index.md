Hi, Iâ€™m Vipin â€” a Site Reliability Engineer focused on designing resilient infrastructure, automating the boring, and reducing cognitive load for humans and machines alike.

Iâ€™m currently working at Salesforce, building systems that scale with confidence. I spend a lot of time thinking about AI-native ops, clean architecture, and making tools that feel like magic.

This space is where I write, experiment, and document what Iâ€™m learning.  
Sometimes about DevOps. Sometimes about life. Sometimes about building a better internet.

Take a look around.  
If something resonates, say hi ðŸ‘‡
